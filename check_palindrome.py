# Write a function that takes a string as an input
# and returns true if it's a palindrome, false otherwise.
#
# A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols
# that reads the same backwards as forwards.
#
# Only alphanumeric characters should be considered.
#
# Examples:
#    "Ala"
#    "Imi"
#    "racecar"
#    "Taco cat"
#    "Borrow or rob?"
#    "12/21/33 12:21"
#    "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama"
