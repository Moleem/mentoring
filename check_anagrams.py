# Write a function that takes two strings as an input
# and returns true if they are anagrams, false otherwise.
#
# An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
# typically using all the original letters exactly once.
#
# Letter capitalization, whitespaces and punctuation marks should be ignored.
#
# Examples:
#    "Silent" = "Listen"
#    "Thing" = "Night"
#    "Teacher" = "Cheater"
#    "Tom Marvolo Riddle" = "I am Lord Voldemort!"
